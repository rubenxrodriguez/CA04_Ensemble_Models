# BSAN6070_CA04_Ensemble_Methods
## Overview
This project implements and compares four ensemble methods for income classification using census data. The models predict whether individuals' income exceeds $50K/year based on features like hours worked per week, education, race/sex, and age. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature encoding, and comprehensive evaluation of Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost classifiers with hyperparameter optimization for n_estimators.

## Key Features
Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline

Visual exploratory data analysis

Comparison of four ensemble methods

Hyperparameter tuning for n_estimators

Performance metrics visualization
